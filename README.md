# get-a-job-cards

This app isn't meant to be perfect. It is meant to document my progress as I learn and grow as an Android developer. Part of my intent with this project is to take the time to play and learn so I can get to know ALL of the code. There are plans for making it pretty...those will come later...I want to get through some of the meat first.  

By design, I am working though various complexity levels. For example, the first iteration read the flash card data from a text file, then I moved to using SQLite and now I'm working on switching over to Firebase. It's all part of the journey, so please pardon my mess as things evolve.
